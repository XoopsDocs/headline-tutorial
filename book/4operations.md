# 4.0 Operating Instructions

To use this module you simply need to enter the details of news feeds you wish to use on your site (see ‘List headlines’ below), and ensure that your user groups have access rights to the Headlines module (and block, if you decide to use it). Once the feeds are configured they are self-maintaining – they will update automatically as the remote websites refresh their content.
