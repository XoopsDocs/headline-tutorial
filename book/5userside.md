# 5.0 The User Side


The Headlines module is very simple from the user perspective. The Headlines index page displays a list of available feeds at the top. Users can view different feeds simply by selecting a link from the list. The contents of the currently selected feed are displayed below. Users can select articles/items of interest, which open the remote (source) site in a new window.
